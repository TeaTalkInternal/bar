2oz Bakerâ€™s bourbon
0.25oz simple syrup
Garnish: 1 mint bouquet

Put the bourbon and simple syrup in a julep tin. Fill the tin halfway with crushed ice. Stir with  teaspoon, churning the ice as you go, for about 10 seconds, holding the tin by the rom so the entire tin can eventually frost up. Add more crushed ice to fill the drink two-thirds full and stir until the tin is completely frosted. Add more ice to form a cone about the rim. Garnish with the mint bouquet in the center of the ice and serve with a straw.
